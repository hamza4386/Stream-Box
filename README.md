# 📖 About the Project

Stream Box was built to simulate a modern streaming service experience. The project focuses on a high-quality UI/UX with smooth transitions, a dark-themed aesthetic, and responsive design elements. It includes multiple pages such as Home, About, Plans, Login, and Contact, providing a complete site navigation flow.

The project currently serves as a static frontend, utilizing vanilla JavaScript for dynamic interactions like movie searching and genre filtering.
